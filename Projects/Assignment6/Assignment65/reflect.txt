For this assignment, I built a 3D OpenGL scene using OpenTK in C#. The program sets up a cube with basic vertex and fragment shaders to display color and lighting. I implemented a free-look camera system that lets the user move around the scene using the keyboard (WASD) and mouse to look around, similar to an FPS camera. The camera also supports zooming with the scroll wheel and automatically adjusts when the window is resized. Most of the setup focused on creating and linking shaders, uploading vertex data to the GPU, and handling input updates smoothly.

The main challenges were getting the OpenTK version to work properly and dealing with namespace or missing reference issues during setup. I also ran into small bugs with the mouse controls and cursor locking, but after some testing and cleanup, the camera movement feels natural. Debugging OpenGL state errors and making sure matrices were passed correctly to the shader took a bit of trial and error too. Overall, it was a good learning experience in understanding how OpenGL, shaders, and camera math all connect together.
