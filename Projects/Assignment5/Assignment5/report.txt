For this assignment, I made a 3D cube in OpenTK and added the Phong lighting model to make it look more realistic. The lighting has ambient, diffuse, and specular parts, and I used one point light at position (2, 2, 2). When the cube rotates, you can see the light reflect and create shiny spots which shows the specular effect working.

The hardest part was getting the normals to work right because at first, the lighting didnâ€™t move properly when the cube rotated. I had to fix how the normals were being passed and transformed in the vertex shader. Once I did that, everything looked good. I also had to make sure the shader uniforms were linked correctly between the C# code and GLSL.

Overall, this helped me understand how the Phong lighting model works and how each part (ambient, diffuse, specular) affects how an object looks in 3D. The result is a cube with smooth lighting that changes when it moves or when the camera changes.
