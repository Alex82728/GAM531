For my project I added a few new movements like jumping, running, crouching and climbing ladders. Running works when you hold shift, jump is space bar, crouch is down arrow, and climbing works when you go near a ladder and press up or down. I also added a moving camera that follows the player and a cool parallax background with mountains and clouds so the game doesn’t look plain.

The player has a bunch of states like idle, walk, run, jump, fall, crouch, and climb. The code switches between them depending on what keys are pressed. For example, you can only jump when you’re on the ground, or climb if you’re on a ladder. The animation keeps the last frame showing when you stop moving so it doesn’t just snap back weirdly.

At first the camera was super messy and would lose the player when moving around, but I fixed it by smoothing it out and stopping it from going past the world edge. Climbing was also hard to get right, it wouldn’t always detect the ladder, so I made the hit area bigger. Crouching looked off at first too because the feet went inside the ground, but I fixed that by adjusting the position. After all that, everything moves smoother and looks way better.
